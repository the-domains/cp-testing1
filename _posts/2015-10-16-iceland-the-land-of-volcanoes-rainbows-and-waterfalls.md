I had the opportunity to travel to Iceland this summer and do a self-drive tour around the lesser traveled Westfjords of Iceland.  What an amazing place...   The country is such a vastly different landscape than what I'm used to here in Alberta.  It was almost like looking at a scene from Jurassic Park or something with huge moss-covered mountains everywhere with a waterfall pouring out the side of it at least every few km's.  A week was definitely not enough time to spend in the magical country.  When I go back I am definitely taking my fly rod!
