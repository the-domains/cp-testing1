I had the opportunity to travel to Iceland this summer and do a self-drive tour around the lesser traveled Westfjords of Iceland. What an amazing place... The country is such a vastly different landscape than what I'm used to here in Alberta. It was almost like looking at a scene from Jurassic Park or something with huge moss-covered mountains everywhere with a waterfall pouring out the side of it at least every few km's. A week was definitely not enough time to spend in the magical country. When I go back I am definitely taking my fly rod! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9f2b003c-4c5b-49ed-a8df-c0f3ebe6eb88.jpg)
